        packaging improvements

1.420   2007-02-23
        reduce use of unneeded variables during creation
        fix bugs that skipped creating headers with false values
        use standard crlf for creating mail
          A changelog entry below indicates that this was not the goal, but
          all the code seems as if it was meant to do this.  There was a bug
          in the logic, and there were no tests.

1.41    2006-07-03
        don't use no_plan in test; it breaks under old Test::More

        use Email::Date

        Handle undefined values in the header list properly.
